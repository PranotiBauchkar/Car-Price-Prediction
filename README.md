# Car Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Description
The **Car Price Prediction** project is a machine learning application that predicts the **selling price of a car** based on various features such as brand, model, year, fuel type, transmission, and kilometers driven.

This project helps understand how **data preprocessing, regression models, and prediction** work in real-world scenarios.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Car prices depend on many factors. Manually estimating a fair price is difficult.  
This project uses **machine learning algorithms** to predict car prices accurately.
